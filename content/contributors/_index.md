CNCF WG's are created and curated by the CNCF TOC and driven by the community members. CNCF TOC repo provides more [details](https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/master/workinggroups#cncf-working-groups) on the purpose and goals of WG's, together with the [list of them](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/README.md#working-groups).
